Steps to run the project.
1. To connect to the database, add host, username, password and database name in config.php file.
2. Import the file database.sql in your database.

4. SignUp to login the application. (credentials for testing purpose-> username: prerita password:a@123)

Note:  For custom search using google search api, we need GOOGLE SEARCH API KEY, SEARCH ENGINE ID. So for testing purpose, I have included the dummy api response.
